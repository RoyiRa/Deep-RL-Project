# Deep-RL-Project

In this project we:

1. Solve the LunarLanderContinuous-V2 environment
   1. Implement DDQN
   2. Quantization
   3. Experiment with Prioritized Experience Replay
   4. Fine-tune DDQN (LR, number of layers, number of nodes in layers, batch normalization, decay rate, error functions)
      1. Learning rate
      2. Number of layers
      3. Number of nodes in layers
      4. Batch Normalization
      5. Decay rate
      6. Error function (MSE vs. Huber)
      7. Discount factor
      8. Batch size
   5. Reward clipping
   6. Add uncertainty to the Lunar Lander environment, since real-world observations are sometimes noisy
   7. Implement Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient 
2. Write a report about the different topics we learned in the course
